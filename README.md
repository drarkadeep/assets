# I am doing a horrible job...

I know, Satya Nadella may not like this, but I am using this repo as sort of a CDN for my website hosted on Netlify...

- Are there better ways to this? **Yes.**
- Is this at all a good way to do this? **No.**

### Then why am I doing this?
According to Gemini's analysis of Github ToS, I'm probably not breaching any terms. So, why not ;)
